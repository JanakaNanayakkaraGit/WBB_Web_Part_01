                                    <p class="card-text congr">The Sri Lankan people as a whole are going through a rather difficult period. We are aware that especially the daily wage earners such as hired workers and plantation workers are facing many economic problems at this time.In order to provide relief to these people who are caught up in an economic storm,
                                        the government has implemented several new programs through the interim budget of 2022.
                                        The Welfare Benefit Board will be reactivated accordingly. Although the Welfare Benefits Act became a law in 2002, it has not yet been properly implemented in the country.
                                        Addressing all these issues, government welfare programs are now better targeted by the Welfare Benefits Board.A new mechanism will also be installed to identify beneficiaries through impartial and verifiable criteria, which will ensure that transparent rules and systems are in place.
                                        The state welfare concept combined with information technology will provide an opportunity to ensure efficient service to the target community and I offer my heartiest congratulations for this new program.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text secr">There are many social safety nets schemes in Sri Lanka. They are aligned in the fields of social services, health and nutrition, education, agriculture. The objective of each of these schemes is to ensure a better living condition for low-income families.
                                        For all these welfare benefit schemes, the government spends about 200 billion rupees per year.
                                        Samurdhi Subsidy, Allowance for the Elderly, Allowance for CKDU Patients, Public Assistance and Allowance for the Disabled will be implemented under the Welfare Benefit Act established under the Welfare Benefit Act No. 24 of 2002 in the first phase for those who are eligible. Applications have been invited for re-identification. Collecting data using the personal mobile phones of the officers attached to all the divisional secretariats in the island is unprecedented and should be appreciated.
                                        At this time when our country is facing economic difficulties,
                                        I sincerely hope that this effort will be successful in all respects by focusing on low-income families.</p>

                        <p class="card-text comi">Welfare Benefits Board informs “Comfort where required”.
                            Sri Lanka is a welfare state that has been implementing many of the welfare benefit programs implemented by the government for decades for low-income families who are unable to maintain good living conditions.
                            These programs are funded by taxpayers. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that such programs run efficiently and effectively.In terms of the Welfare Benefits Act No. 24 of 2002 and the Welfare Benefits Board established under it,
                            which should have been done for twenty years but could not be achieved due to any reasons,
                            criteria-based as the first step in creating the "Social Register or Integrated Welfare Benefits Data System" Efforts have been made to identify eligible persons for payment of all welfare subsidy benefits under a transparent selection process.
                            This effort is one of the few that will reform, strengthen and modernize the various welfare benefit schemes in the country.
                            It is also a pleasure for those involved in the mission of creating an efficient and effective data system that ensures the security of the beneficiaries.However,
                            the Welfare Benefit Board is able to make the necessary corrections by providing and obtaining the information of individuals and families very accurately and truthfully during the identification process.
                            Identification of eligible persons to receive welfare benefits - 2022 Program All the best!</p>
